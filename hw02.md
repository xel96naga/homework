## Explain Words

1. information

Information refers to the object of transmission and processing of audio, message and communication systems, and generally refers to all the contents of human society. Man can understand and transform the world by acquiring and recognizing different information from nature and society to distinguish different things. In all communication and control systems, information is a form of universal connection. In 1948, the mathematician Shannon pointed out in his paper entitled "Mathematical Theory of Communication" that "Information is something used to eliminate random uncertainty". The most basic universal unit for creating all things in the universe is information.

2. Positional notation

Positional notation or place-value notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers. Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as Roman numerals) for its use of the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude (for example, the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place"). This greatly simplified arithmetic, leading to the rapid spread of the notation across the world.

3. Algorithm

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this sound listen)) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.

4. software bug

A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The process of fixing bugs is termed "debugging" and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs, and since the 1950s, some computer systems have been designed to also deter, detect or auto-correct various computer bugs during operations.
