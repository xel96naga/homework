1 and 0 =0
1 and 1 =1
0 and 0 =0

 and就是和，和我们日常说话一个意思
 我是个男人 并且 我是个女人，你看，显然错误。
 我是个男人 并且 我长胡子，  你看，显然正确。


1 or 1=1
1 or 0=1
0 or 0=0

or就是或者，和我们日常说话一个意思
我穿了短裙或者我穿了超短裙，你看，只要我穿其中一个，就正确。
两个都不穿，就错。


XOR

1 xor 1=0
1 xor 0=1
0 xor 1=1
0 xor 0=0

异或异或 相异为1 相同为0

1. Logic garte

In electronics, a logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. Depending on the context, the term may refer to an ideal logic gate, one that has for instance zero rise time and unlimited fan-out, or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device[1] (see Ideal and real op-amps for comparison).

2. Boolean algebra

In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively. Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers, and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction and denoted as ∧, the disjunction or denoted as ∨, and the negation not denoted as ¬. It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same way that elementary algebra describes numeric relations.
